**Distributed Ledger**
Also share ledger and DLT, it's an information record method using network synchronization mechanism to synchronize and share digital information among multiple ledgers. Distributed ledgers have no central data storage or administrators. They are connected through P2P network and achieve validated data through consensus. Each ledger saves the identical data. 

**Consensus**
It refers to the method and process of transactions and data decision-making through majority approval. Consensus usually implies the completion and the process of decision-making.

**Decentralized Game **
It refers to the type of game software in which main logic and codes are stored in and driven by distributed ledger network. For such games, central service is not a necessity. The main logic and even the entire logic of the game are determined by smart contract in distributed ledger network.

**Smart Contract** 
A script with Turing completeness, runs on contract virtual machine in distributed ledger network, performing functions, such as running transaction logic, network data interaction, and information transfer.

**Blockchain** 
It encrypts the transaction data in distributed ledgers through cryptography and concatenates data record mode. Each set of transaction data is a block, and each block contains encrypted hashes and timestamp of the previous one and is difficult to falsify. The Merkel Tree is usually used for validation on blockchains.

**Homogeneous Digital Assets**
They are a type of digital assets applied to distributed ledger network bearing no difference with assets instance, and can be combined for computation upon identical unit and type of measurement. Quantities can be divided based on the set accuracy.

**Non-Homogeneous Digital Assets **
They are a type of digital assets applied to distributed ledger network with unique assets instance. They embrace different data items and content except its unique identification. Non-homogeneous assets of the same type are indivisible and cannot be combined directly.

**Worldview** 
It represents an identification to distinguish story settings, characters, props, rule settings, and utility scope in games.

**Authentication Procedure **
It refers to the process of privilege confirmation between business entities and digital assets, and also stands for the process of establishing trust relationship between business entities and distributed ledger network.

**Digital Signature**
It's an authentication mechanism that ensures non-repudiation of identity through public-private key algorithm, and ECC-based public-private key algorithm is usually applied to the decentralized distributed ledger network. Digital signatures in this paper are in line with the requirements of Article 13 of Electronic Signature Law of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China.

**Decentralized Database** 
It refers to the structural storage of identical data copies in decentralized distributed ledger. Contracts or other business entities can store structural data on distributed network through declaration.

**Basic Identity**
It's mainly used to identify, authenticate, read and modify digital assets. In this paper it is defined by asset publishers, meeting the requirements of distributed ledger network and bearing uniqueness of the entire network.

**Session Identity **
It's mainly used to identify, authenticate, read and modify extensible data of digital assets in specific game world and stages. In this paper it is defined by asset publishers, meeting the requirements of distributed ledger network and bearing uniqueness of the entire network.

**Inherent Data Zone** 
It's divided by basic identity, and used to describe the data zone of basic information of non-homogeneous digital assets standard, including unique ID, basic attributes, and world view.

**Extensible Data Zone** 
is used to describe the data zone of game world, stage and other information of non-homogeneous digital assets standard, including business data of related games and contracts. Extensible data zone of different game world or contracts is divided by session identity.

**Active Privilege** 
It refers to the executable privilege of digital assets, such as editable and operable privilege within a certain range. It involves the modification of specified domain, and the sending and transfer of assets in extensible data zone of data.
Owner privilege stands for the privilege of digital assets owners. It overrides behavior privilege, and can delete the specified domain in extensible data zone in addition to the scope covered by behavior privilege.

**Data Structure** 
It represents a specific pattern for data storage and circulation in distributed ledger network, including but not limited to: point-to-point transmission, ledger unit data, digital asset data, smart contract data, and intermediate data.

**Service Provider **
It means the object that provides service, including external operation interfaces, contracts with access right, and user interfaces.

**Cross-Net Mapping **
It refers to the digital assets data with specific structure that enables to map to different distributed ledger networks through business entities.
