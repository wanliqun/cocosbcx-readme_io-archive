There are two ways to update the contract:

##1. Using the JS-SDK DEMO program
[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/abb73b7-image_7.png",
        "image (7).png",
        3028,
        1214,
        "#f7f6fa"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
The contract can be updated by entering the name and code of the contract directly. The update records and corresponding codes can be viewed conveniently, and everything is traceable.


##2. Use the cli_wallet command
