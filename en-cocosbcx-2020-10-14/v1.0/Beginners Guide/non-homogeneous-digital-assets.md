**Non-homogeneous digital assets**

Different from homogeneous assets in traditional currency, non-homogeneous digital assets are an asset type used in distributed ledger network with unique asset instance, of which has different data items and content except unique identification. Non-homogeneous digital assets of the same type defer combination and separation.

For example, Bitcoin is a typical homogeneous digital asset, indistinguishable and interchangeable. User account receives one Bitcoin while transferring another with balance and value unchanged. This is also another feature of homogeneous assets - detachable and annexable. 

In contrast, non-homogeneous digital assets are unique and indivisible with specific attributes. BCX-NHAS-1808, in particular, is more complicated regarding extensible data, nested assets and assets transfer (See featture descriptions of 1808 Standard Assets). 

For example, items of World of Warcraft are taken as non-homogeneous digital assets, and players can receive Blessed Blade of the Windseeker when mission completed. This equipment contains skills including but not limited to attack, speed, and weight, and information is provided in the form of extensible data of non-homogeneous digital assets. The two weapons, considering that players obtain the same weapon, will be stored separately rather than combined, although they embrace identical skills, attributes and descriptions. Owners can transfer or exchange equipment among other players, or destroy it. Information of equipment is traceable on-chain.

That is to say, non-homogeneous assets digitalize unique objects, such as actual objects and game items, which play a decisive role in the development of blockchain gaming industry.

**Non-homogeneous digital assets in games**

According to Cocos-BCX White Paper, blockchain gaming has four phases: 

• Fungible tokens as a settlement measure of in-game economy
• Exchange and inter-conversion of game currencies and assets
• Key game algorithms on blockchains
• Whole games on blockchains
In the second phase, “props” not only refer to those props in the games, but various digital assets with uniqueness as well, such as items, equipment, roles information and stage data. In the third and fourth phase, the concept of “props” even expands to game resources, map setting, plot data, DLC, and etc.

We believe that a well-defined standardized non-homogeneous digital asset serves as the cornerstone of blockchain gaming industry.

**Why we need standardized non-homogeneous assets**

Digital asset standardization is a basic and essential component for sustainable, extensible and scientific operation of blockchain network, and has the following significance:

• Non-homogeneous assets standardization guarantees the definition, format, and structural specification of asset life cycle, provides good compatibility and interpretability, and enables assets exchange among third parties. 
• Non-homogeneous assets standardization saves miscellaneous customized structure, and improves operation efficiency and circulation of blockchain network. 
• Standardized assets facilitate initialization, retrieval, parsing and etc. developers free themselves from how to interact with various assets. The observance of standardized definitions makes them more attentive to the design of assets content. 

Take ERC-721 non-homogeneous digital assets standard as an example, any non-homogeneous digital assets defined by the ERC-721 can be parsed, retrieved, and modified by the contract or service of the same mode. Different ERC-721 assets can be compatible by changing their identification information through interfaces without modifying contract/ service codes.
