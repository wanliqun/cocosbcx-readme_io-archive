Cocos-BCX blockchain system will charge for different types of operations separately. The amount of the fee is configured in the blockchain system. The change of parameters is determined by the committee.

There are two kinds of transaction fee:
1.	General transaction fee
2.	Lifetime membership transaction fee

These two kinds of transaction fee are corresponding to regular members and lifetime members respectively. The transaction fees set for lifetime members are generally lower, therefore, we encourage users to upgrade to lifetime membership for more benefits.

At present, Cocos-BCX is still in its alpha testing. After the official launch of the mainnet, the cost of the specific operations will be listed in detail.
