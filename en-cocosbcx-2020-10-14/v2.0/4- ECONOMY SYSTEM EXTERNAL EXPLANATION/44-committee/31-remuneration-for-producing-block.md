**Definition**
Every time an active BP produces an effective block (excluding the invalid block caused by network reasons, delayed response and other factors), the system divides a certain amount of funds from the reserve fund pool, which is called "block payment".

**Issuance Rules**
In each block pruducing cycle, the chain system allocates a certain amount of COCOS from the reserve fund pool (the amount is managed by the council) to distribute the block remuneration to the active BP of each block.

**Issuing Cycle**
The current value setting of block generation time is 2 seconds.

**Source of Reward**
Pool of reserve funds.

**Distribution Method**
The system automatically registers the accumulated remuneration of the production block, which needs to be collected manually by BP.

**Reward Size**
The reward value is the core parameter of the chain system, which is decided by the council.
