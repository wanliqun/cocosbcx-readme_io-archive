The BCX-NHAS-1808 standard is essentially a non-homogeneous asset standard, which is applicable not only to the Cocos-BCX blockchain system, but also to other blockchains. Assets that meet the 1808 standard can also be exchanged cross-chain through our exchange gateway, making it easier for developers to extend the game content to different blockchain systems.

We are currently working closely with other public chains to promote and implement the 1808 standard with progress as follows:

## EOS1808
Implementation of the 1808 standard on EOS and related documentation 
Address: [https://github.com/Cocos-BCX/EOS-1808](https://github.com/Cocos-BCX/EOS-1808)

## ERC1808
Implementation of the 1808 standard on Ethereum and related documentation Address: [https://github.com/Cocos-BCX/ERC-1808](https://github.com/Cocos-BCX/ERC-1808)
