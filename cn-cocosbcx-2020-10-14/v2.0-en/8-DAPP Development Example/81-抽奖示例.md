We’ll introduce to the development process with an example of a dice program with specific source code: [cocos-dice-sample](https://github.com/Cocos-BCX/cocos-dice-sample)。This includes contract development, deployment, debugging, and front-end contract call.

We hope the community have a complete understanding of DApp development based on Cocos-BCX.


##Game Rules

The game rules of Dice are very simple, with following specific steps:
1.	Set the bet amount
2.	Adjust the slider to bet on the upper limit of the dice number and change the chance of winning
3.	Click “Roll” to place a bet. If the result is less than your bet number, you will be awarded immediately. The program will make the settlement based on the winning rate.
