The Committee is the governance body of Cocos-BCX blockchian.

The Cocos-BCX blockchain has a set of parameters approved by Cocos holders. Cocos holders can define their preferred set of parameters to create a so-called committee member or vote for an existing committee member. The Cocos-BCX committee consists of several active committee members.

Cocos-BCX has the following blockchain parameters at the very beginning:
1.	Fee structure: the fees that users pay for their transactions.
2.	Block interval: it is the time interval at which the block is generated, which is also the maximum size of the block/transaction
3.	Expiration parameter: the maximum expiration interval
4.	Witness parameter: the maximum number of witnesses (block producers)
5.	Committee parameters: the maximum number of committee members
6.	Witness reward: the reward given to each witness for each signed block

Please note that the given parameter set is used as an example and the parameters of the network may change over time.

In addition to defined parameters, any active witness can propose an agreement or business upgrade (i.e. hard fork) that can be voted (or opposed) by the Cocos holder. When the total number of votes for the hard fork is greater than the median witness weight w, the hard fork is effective.

The corresponding rules of the Committee are being worked out.
