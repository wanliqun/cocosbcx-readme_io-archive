The referral program is to motivate the community to introduce more new users. It is a single level program compared with the Multi-Level Marketing (MLM) program, where recommended individuals can opt out by upgrading their accounts to the Lifetime Membership (LTM). Each lifetime member can receive a refund by referring new members based on a sub-account associated with us.

Each Cocos-BCX holder can become a lifetime member and participate in the referral program. In this program:

The regular accounts are free to register, but do not qualify for the referral program and the refund of transaction fees. 

For lifetime members, transaction fees will be refunded for each newly registered account introduced by the lifetime member.

Detailed rules are being worked out.
