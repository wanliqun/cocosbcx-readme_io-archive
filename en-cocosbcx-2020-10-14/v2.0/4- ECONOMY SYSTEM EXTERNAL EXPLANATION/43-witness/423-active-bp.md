It refers to the node that is in the forefront of the number of votes obtained in the active BP campaign (the specific number of nodes is set by the Council), and is responsible for the block work in the actual operation. It is the resource provider of the whole chain system.
It should be noted that the system will reorder after the end of each maintenance cycle. Active BP may degenerate into a candidate due to insufficient votes, and the new active BP can only be selected from the candidates.
