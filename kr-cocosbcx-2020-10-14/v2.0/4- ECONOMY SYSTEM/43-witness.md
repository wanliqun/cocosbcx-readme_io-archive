In Cocos-BCX, the witness is to collect transactions, package them into blocks, sign and broadcast them throughout the network. They are basically block producers of potential consensus mechanisms.

For each successfully packaged block, the witness receives the block rewards from the limited reserve pool at a rate determined by the COCOS holders through an approved vote.

Specific witness participation and voting mechanisms are being worked out.
