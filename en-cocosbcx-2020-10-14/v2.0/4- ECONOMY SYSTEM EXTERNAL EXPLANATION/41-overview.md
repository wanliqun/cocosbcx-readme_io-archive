The core of bitcoin's success is to solve a technical problem by economic means. Therefore, the setting of the economic system is the top priority of the public chain project, which determines the final success or failure of the public chain. According to the technology and application characteristics of our project, we follow several core purposes in setting the economic system:
  * Encourage system participants to work together for the growth of the network
  * Reduce the threshold of users
  * Lower content production threshold for developers
  * Protect the interests of the whole network
