The Council is composed of council members. As the governance organization in the chain, the council can participate in the resolutions of proposals, parameter configuration and other matters in the chain;
Among the candidates of the board of directors, the members of the board of directors are elected by the number of votes, and the top n (configurable) candidates become members of the board of directors. As with active BP, board members may degenerate into candidates due to insufficient votes, and new board members can only be elected from the candidates.
**Note: **the chain maintenance cycle cannot be modified by the council.
