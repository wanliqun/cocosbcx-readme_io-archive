* The voting credentials shall not be traded or transferred;
  * The account can obtain voting credentials by mortgage of COCOS, with the ratio of fixed value (1 mortgage of COCOS = 1 voting credentials);
  * The voting credentials are one vote for multiple votes. For example, mortgage 10 cocos to obtain 10 voting credentials and vote for three roles A / B / C respectively, then the three roles A / B / C respectively obtain 10 voting weights;
  * Voting for redemption takes a certain period (the rules here need to be improved).
