We can logout the contract deployment account in the js-sdk demo, and register a new account to call the contract's bet interface and place a bet. The specific operation is shown as follows:

      ]
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
Enter the contract name or ID congtract.dicegame, interface name: bet, and the parameters of 51 and 200, which indicates a winning chance of 50 and a bet amount of 200 COCOS. Click execute to view the results of the execution through the console.

You can also use the cli_wallet naming line interface. For details, please refer to Hello World!
