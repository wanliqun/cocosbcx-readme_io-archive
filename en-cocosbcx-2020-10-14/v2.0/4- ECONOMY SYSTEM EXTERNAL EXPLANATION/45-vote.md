In the design of service charge, we need to balance the cost of network participants and the overall interests of the network, and adopt gas resource model. A special asset gas is introduced for the execution driven measurement of multiple transactions in the system. Gas assets themselves are not tradable or transferable.
In the execution of the transaction, a certain amount of gas needs to be consumed, which is related to the calculation and storage required in the execution of the transaction. The specific value is decided by the council vote.
